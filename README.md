# SECRETS PROJECT (Auntication & Security)

## About The Project

Basically [secrets](https://eniola-secrete-app.herokuapp.com/) is something that is kept or meant to be kept unknown or unseen by others. But in this  [my secrets](https://eniola-secrete-app.herokuapp.com/) project your secrets
are going to be seen "anonymously" by everyone :). yeah it sounds weird right probably you can come up with a better name for this project for me i would really appreciate :) lol alright that aside let's move on...

## Requirement

* An Active internet is needed to test the web app
* A PC or Mobile phone works fine
* Gmail Account to test user SIGNUP & SIGNIN with google (Not Compulsory) you can sign up manually if you wish
* Facebook Account to test SIGNUP & SIGNIN with facebook (also Not Compulsory) you can sign up manually if you wish

## Here's some cool features of the Project:
### 1. Registration Page
![reg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107508295/181660005-aa732ea7-7565-4f07-b3ed-0e4395cd3e42.PNG)

* You can Register by just inputing your mail and password.
* other wise use the Google or Facebook signup link, trust me its Very fast and easy! : )

### 2. Some might be worried about their password being tracked buh Don't worry about that, salting and hashing methods are appplied to all password submited so even me the developer can't see it, its all encrypted : )
#### so after signing up your password looks like this below
![password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107508295/181660320-6fb45589-10fc-44cb-97a1-7fac797a0d07.PNG)

#### Other cool features include:
* View secretes without registering (just append "/secrets") to the URL !!! note you can only view secrets not submit, to submit secrets  you would have to Register or log in so it can be stored in my database.
* User can log out immediately when done
* this app make use of cookies and sessions so you still come back even ehen you visit other websites, or close the tab without logging in again, unless you logout or close the browser thats when your session expires and requires you to log in!
* User friendly
* Fast sign up and sign in and many more... : }
